Flax Search Service Tutorial
============================

Overview
========

This document, and associated files, covers the basics of running the Flax Search Service
and using it to index, retrieve, and search for documents using a simple schema. It is 
applicable to all the existing client libraries (Python, PHP and Perl).


Requirements
============

To follow this tutorial, you will need:  
FIXME: links

    1. Xapian 1.0.6 or later installed on your computer.
    2. Python 2.5 or 2.6 (required for the search service).
    3. Xapian Python bindings.
    4. Flax Search Service and Search Clients.

To follow the tutorial with the PHP client library, you will need the PHP 5 command-line 
interpreter. Perl 5 is required for the Perl client.

The ``curl`` command may be useful for talking directly to the Search Service from the 
command line.


Getting Started
===============

If necessary, install the required software. Then start the Search Service by cd'ing 
to the ``flax_search_service`` directory and running::

    python runserver.py
    
This will start the server listening on port 8080. To use a different port (if for example
you have an existing service on 8080), edit the ``settings.py`` file and replace "8080"
in the ``server_bind_address`` parameter with a suitable value.

By default, the search service stores data in ``/tmp``. To specify a different location,
supply it as a parameter when starting the service, e.g.::

    python runserver.py /usr/lib/flaxdata

If you have the ``curl`` command available, you can test Flax by opening another terminal
window and running::

    curl http://localhost:8080/

This will return information about the search service, formatted as JSON, e.g.::

    {"backends": {}, "versions": {"PROTOCOL": "dev20090312", "SERVER": "0.1"}}

Don't worry about the exact meaning of these values for now!


Loading the client libraries
============================

In order to run the examples for Python, Perl or PHP, the relevant interpreter needs to be
able to locate the client libraries for loading. These are located in subdirectories
of ``flax_search_clients``. The simplest method may be to create symbolic links from the
appropriate client directory into the tutorial directory, e.g. for Python::

    cd docs/tutorial/python
    ln -s ../../../flax_search_clients/python/flax .

Alternatively, add the location of the client library to ``PYTHONPATH`` (for Python), 
``@INC`` (for Perl), or your PHP configuration file.


Creating a Database
===================

The search server can support multiple databases, each of which is identified by a name.
Currently, the name must only consist of ASCII letters and numbers, plus the characters "."
and/or "_" (we plan to lift this restriction in a future release).

To create a database, an HTTP POST request is made to the database resource URL on the
search server. This will usually be done via the client libraries, and in this tutorial
is handled in the next setp.


Setting up a Schema
===================

In Flax, documents consist of a simple flat set of named fields, where each field has one
or more string values. Fields may be indexed for full-text searching or act as Boolean filters,
and may be stored in the database or not (indexed fields do not need to be stored in order
to be used for searching). Other options, e.g. for spelling correction or stemming (FIXME)
can also be set on a field-by-field basis. The set of named fields and associated parameters
is called a *schema*, and must be configured before documents are added to the database.

The example data in this tutorial consists of a short set of book descriptions, stored in the
files `books1.txt` and `books2.txt`. Each record has the following fields:

    * ``title``:    The title of the book.
    * ``author``:   The author of the book.
    * ``first``:    The first sentence in the book.
    * ``isbn``:     The ISBN (International Standard Book Number).

We will handle these fields as follow:

    * ``title``:    Index as free text, and store in DB.
    * ``author``:   Index as a Boolean filter, and store.
    * ``first``:    Index as free text, and *don't* store.
    * ``isbn``:     Use as document ID.

It is slightly artificial not to store the ``first`` field, since it has such low storage
requirements, but it shows that this is possible. In addition, we will set the ``language``
parameter of the free text fields to be ``en``, which will apply English stemming to the
indexing and search processes (FIXME).

Note that there is no ``isbn`` field, as we will use this as the document ID (which is
separate from the field structure).

To create a database called "books" and set this schema on it, run the ``t1_create_db``
script in your language of choice. Each step is described by comments in the script file.

Assuming this runs without error, you will now have a database called "books" with a
suitable schema for indexing the book data. You can get a list of databases by GETing
the ``dbs`` resource on the server, e.g. using ``curl``::

    curl http://localhost:8080/v1/dbs
    ["books"]

Or to get the database schema::

    curl http://localhost:8080/v1/dbs/books/schema
    {"templates": {}, "fields": {"author": {"exacttext": true, "store": true}, 
    "first": {"store": true, "freetext": {"language": "en"}}, 
    "title": {"store": true, "freetext": {"language": "en"}}}, 
    "groups": {}, "language": "none"}

The script ``t2_show_schema`` does a similar job using the client libraries, but separates
out the field information from the rest of the schema and displays it more tidily.


Indexing Documents
==================

Documents are added to a database by POSTing them to the /docs/ resource of the search
server. They are represented as JSON objects, where keys are fieldnames and values are
strings (or lists of strings, for multiple field values). In the client libraries, this
is represented by the ``add_document`` method of the database object.

For reasons of efficiency, Flax does not make added documents immediately available for
searching.
