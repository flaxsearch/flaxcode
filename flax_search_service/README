Flax Search Service
===================

Flax Search Service (FSS) combines powerful, high-level indexing and search 
features with a clean, RESTful JSON API. It is based on the Xapian search 
engine core, and is released under the MIT Open Source license (note, however,
that Xapian itself is licensed under the GPL).


Prerequisites
-------------
In order to run FSS, you must have Python 2.5 or 2.6 installed. You also need
to have installed Xapian Core and its Python bindings (release 1.0.12 recommended).
These available here: http://xapian.org/download (note that prebuild versions are
available for Ubuntu/Debian Linux and Windows).

If you are using the FSS client libraries, these have their own prerequisites; 
see the appropriate READMEs for details.


Installation and running
------------------------
FSS does not need to be installed in any particular location. To start the FSS 
server, open a terminal window and run (in the same directory as this README):

    python runserver.py

This starts the server listening on port 8080 of all available interfaces. To change
the port number or bound IP address,  edit the file "settings.py" and change the
'server_bind_address' tuple.

By default, FSS will store databases and configuration under /tmp/flax. To specify
a different path, edit "settings.py" and change the 'data_path' setting, or specify
the path as a command-line parameter, e.g.:

    python runserver.py /var/flax-data


Testing
-------
With the server running, open a browser window and point it at

    http://localhost:8080/ 

(or appropriate address if you have edited "settings.py"). This should display 
something like:

    {"backends": {}, "versions": {"PROTOCOL": "dev20090312", "SERVER": "0.1"}}

The client libraries (especially the PHP client) include tests of various 
service functions, such as database creation and deletion, document indexing
etc. See the client documentation for instructions on running these tests.


Further documentation
---------------------
The FSS API is documented in the file docs/API.rst.

Client documentation and examples are included in the clients/ directory.
