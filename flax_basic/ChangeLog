	* libs/htmltotext/ChangeLog,libs/htmltotext/setup.py: setup.py:
	  Move hardcoded, but system dependent, paths to separate variables
	  at start of script, and mark with a FIXME - we'll need to write a

Wed Jan 09 17:44:45 UTC 2008  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/doc_collection.py: Change the method of
	  testing whether a file should be served to users.  Now, instead
	  of requiring that the file is found in the index, it simply has
	  to be in the set of directories included in the collection.  This
	  means that ancillary files for HTML pages (and any other formats
	  which require them) will work, and also that browsing within the
	  collection will work even if not all of it has yet been indexed.

Wed Jan 09 16:51:13 UTC 2008  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/doc_collection.py: Quote after changing \ to /, instead of

Wed Jan 09 16:30:18 UTC 2008  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/doc_collection.py: Fix bug #163, by changing

	  src/test/sampledocs/relativelinks/foo.html: Some test files for
	  testing relative links in the search results.

Mon Dec 17 15:56:53 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/test/sampledocs/problem_docs/geertz1tx.htm: Add a document in
	  windows-1252 charset - this doesn't get displayed properly in the
	  summaries.

Fri Dec 14 13:36:24 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt,
	  w32setup/setup_svc.py: Make sure we still start the service even
	  if we have to restart; use Windows Installer 3.0 not 3.1 (more
	  backwards compatible); better messages during installation

Fri Dec 07 15:16:45 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt,
	  w32setup/setup_svc.py: yet more MS redistributable files

Fri Dec 07 12:25:04 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* ChangeLog,src/collection_list.py: If deleting the database fails,
	  return after a short break.  Report failure due to other
	  exceptions better, and don't mark a database as deleted if the
	  deletion fails.

Fri Dec 07 12:22:07 GMT 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/collection_list.py: If deleting the database fails, return
	  after a short break.  Report failure due to other exceptions
	  better, and don't mark a database as deleted if the deletion
	  fails.

Fri Dec 07 11:40:22 GMT 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Notify the collection list when an
	  index connection is opened or closed.
	* src/collection_list.py: Add the index connection information to
	  the handle count kept for each collection; avoids attempting to
	  delete underlying databases while a collection is finishing up
	  its indexing.

Fri Dec 07 11:16:21 GMT 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/collection_list.py: Delete the underlying database on disk
	  when the collection is deleted.  This involves several steps:
	   - first, we maintain a "handle count" of the number of handles
	 which are open on databases.  This is incremented whenever a
	 search connection is opened, and decremented when the
	 connection is closed again.  All access to this count is
	 protected by a Condition, which is signalled whenever the
	 count drops to zero.
	   - When a database is deleted, it is marked as deleted (to stop
	 any new connections being made), deleted from the _collections
	 member, and the path of the database is added to the
	 _collections_being_deleted member.
	   - When a database is deleted, a separate thread is started which
	 waits on the condition, and checks for the handle count of the
	 database being deleted dropping to zero.  When it does, the
	 database is deleted from disk.
	   - If the server is stopped before the database is deleted from
	 disk, the _collections_being_deleted entries will be read in
	 when the server is next started, and the database will then be
	 deleted.
	* src/doc_collection.py: Add a ready_to_be_indexed() method, which
	  checks that the collection is due and not held, and not deleted.
	  Change search_conn() uses CollectionList.get_search_connection()
	  to get the connection to the database, rather than doing it
	  directly, so that the connection gets registered.
	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Remove ok_to_index() - call
	  DocCollection.ready_to_be_indexed() instead.
	* src/cpserver.py: Now that CollectionList.new_collection() returns
	  an error message if the collection name is already in use, use
	  that rather than testing ourselves.
	* src/search.py: Refer to the databases to be searched by names,
	  rather than paths.  Call CollectionList.get_search_connection()
	  to get the connection to the databases, rather than doing it
	  ourself, so that the connection gets registered.

Fri Dec 07 11:11:06 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_w32.py: Don't do "except:" - for now, just catch
	  Exception, which will stop any ProcessExit type exceptions being
	  stopped, but ideally we'd just catch the specific exception that
	  means that a registry key wasn't found.

Thu Dec 06 17:43:15 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py: Redirect after deleting a database, so that
	  refresh doesn't cause errors.

Thu Dec 06 13:23:00 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/collection_list.py,src/doc_collection.py,src/flax.py,
	  src/persist.py,src/startflax.py: Rework the way in which flax
	  settings are stored and restored from files. Instead of just
	  pickling (well, shelving) the flax.options object, add a
	  FlaxOptions::to_dict() method, which returns a dict which can
	  then be pickled.  Currently, the DocCollection objects are still
	  put into the dict natively, but everything else placed in the
	  dict is one of (string, list, tuple, dict).  Once the
	  DocCollection objects are resolved, we can start storing the
	  settings as a human-readable format, and can also be more robust
	  to change; we'll be able to read configuration files and upgrade
	  them, since reading them won't rely on the code used to create
	  them being the same as that used to read them. Update
	  configuration version number to 12.  Remove FlaxOptions.filters
	  property, which was never used (externally).  Change the
	  FlaxOptions.formats, FlaxOptions.logger_names and
	  FlaxOptions.languages to be class properties, since they're
	  dependent on the modules available, not user configuration.
	  (Really, they should be available as module properties, or
	  something like that, but this is a convenient way to separate
	  them for now, without requiring any of the code using them to be
	  updated.)  Add FlaxOptions.to_dict() and from_dict(), and convert
	  make_options() into a FlaxOptions.set_to_defaults() method. The
	  flax.options object is now created at module import time, and
	  never overwritten; this removes potential race conditions by
	  stopping it being accessed before being created.  Instead, the
	  persist module updates the options in-place. Add "deleted"
	  attribute to DocCollection objects - this will be used to mark
	  collections which are in the process of being deleted (but isn't
	  yet used - I just wanted to get it in now so I don't have to bump
	  the options file version number again). CollectionList no longer
	  takes a "formats" object: this was just a reference to the
	  formats object in flax.options, and as such can more cleanly be
	  accessed directly (this also makes it obvious that changes in
	  fax.options.formats will be reflected in any new databases
	  created).

Thu Dec 06 10:25:01 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=153 Don't call
	  cherrypy.server.stop as it sometimes blocks indefinitely.

Wed Dec 05 12:27:16 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/admin_banner.html: fix help link; doesn't need a
	  target and correction to 'collections' page name

Wed Dec 05 11:53:55 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/setup_svc.py: fix ref manual path

Wed Dec 05 11:32:47 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/admin_banner.html: Added contextual help link. This
	  needs the ../docs folder to be copied into ./static

Wed Dec 05 11:22:28 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* docs/reference.html,docs/reference.rst: Minor tweaks

Wed Dec 05 10:49:51 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/setup_svc.py: add ref manual & styles

Wed Dec 05 10:36:06 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxservice.py,src/indexserver/indexer.py,src/startflax.py:
	  Call sys.exit_func rather than processing.exit_func to further
	  ensure all atexit handlers are called; also make sure we return
	  the correct code from FlaxMain.join() - fixes for #153

	* src/search.py: Cosmetic change - use conn.OP_AND instead of

	  refactoring to be able to find all the places where
	  SearchConnections are created)

Mon Dec 03 13:29:13 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/indexserver/indexer.py: FIXES:

	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=109 Added some
	  logging (not that "DEBUG" level for this filter will now give all
	  the text it's yielding") Continued through the "unspecified" com
	  errors, since this seems to work. I've added a check that we
	  don't try and repeat the same chunk in case this exception is
	  raised in other situations where the same chunk might be repeated
	  once this exception is raised.

Fri Nov 09 17:15:00 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/setup_svc.py: Put back the rules for the MochiKit dir -
	  they were removed by the last commit, but I assume that was a
	  mistake, because the log message didn't mention removing them.

Fri Nov 09 08:07:16 UTC 2007  paul.x.rudin@gmail.com

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py,src/startflax.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=90 Implemented
	  a DIY process stopping strategy. There are still things I don't
	  entirely understand about why other mechanisms failed to work -
	  see the comments in the code.

Thu Nov 08 17:19:59 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/doc_collection.py: Remove unused "source_file_from_id"

Thu Nov 08 16:14:51 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/w32com_ifilter.py: Took out the call to
	  pythoncom.CoInitializeEx(pythoncom.COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED) and
	  associated paraphanelia, since it's apparently only needed in
	  threads other than the main thread. Added a comment about
	  circumstances under which it may need to be called.

Thu Nov 08 12:46:07 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/collections.html,src/templates.py: Changed indexing
	  state back to Due, to avoid confusion with timed scheduling

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Log any unhandled exception from the

	  sending it to stderr or stdout.

Wed Nov 07 16:13:38 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/collections.html: Properly fixed this time

Wed Nov 07 16:07:13 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

Wed Nov 07 15:46:45 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=95 Added a
	  call to start_indexing at the end of IndexServer.do_indexing() to
	  ensure that if there is another collection due for indexing we
	  kick it off immediately.

Wed Nov 07 15:39:05 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt,
	  w32setup/setup_svc.py: don't need to explicitly copy _xapian.pyd,
	  distutils should pick it up

	* src/search.py:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=72 Chnaged the

	  MochiKit with just the bits we use

Wed Nov 07 14:10:45 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Move the "conn.close()" call out of
	  the finally block, so that it's not called if an error occurs.
	  This should allow a faster shutdown if KeyboardError is raised,
	  and we don't really need to keep the unflushed changes if an
	  error has occurred. Also, add a try:finally clause to
	  IndexProcess.run() which calls processing.process._exit_func(),
	  to try and ensure that children get cleaned up when running as a
	  service (to work around the "exit handlers not being called when
	  run as a service" bug).

Wed Nov 07 14:04:53 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Trivial fix to a comment.

	* src/test/issue72.py: Fix to work.

Wed Nov 07 09:04:55 UTC 2007  paul.x.rudin@gmail.com

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=62 In
	  Indexer.do_indexing logged the traceback rather than printing it.

Wed Nov 07 08:59:30 UTC 2007  paul.x.rudin@gmail.com

	* src/flaxlog.conf:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=62 Ensured
	  that consolehandler is not used by default. It's not compatible
	  with running as a non-console windows application (e.g. running
	  as a windows service).

Wed Nov 07 08:56:45 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	  "[UninstallRun]" that cause an error when processing Flax Site
	  Search.iss. (You could tell that that was a file name if it
	  didn't have spaces in it :))

Tue Nov 06 17:41:19 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/about.html: another feature

Tue Nov 06 17:06:59 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

Mon Nov 05 23:34:56 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt: I'm pretty sure
	  we want the "py2exe" command, not the "install" command.

Mon Nov 05 23:33:31 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/auth.conf,src/startflax.py: Remove auth.conf from SVN, and
	  make startflax.py work fine if auth.conf is missing when the
	  --set-admin-password option is supplied (for other invocations,
	  the auth.conf file is required and will cause a fatal error if
	  it's missing).

Mon Nov 05 23:32:16 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/getsvnrev.py,src/version.py: Tweak format of version numbers

	* src/cplogger.py,src/cpserver.py,src/flax.py,src/flaxlog.conf:
	  Made a special logging manager for the cherrpy infrastructure
	  that intergrates well with the rest of the logging system.

	* src/auth.conf,src/cp.conf,src/flaxauth.py,src/flaxpaths.py,
	  src/startflax.py: Store authentication tokens (ie,
	  username/password) in a separate file.  Add flaxauth module to
	  manage them, and reference this from the cp.conf file to get the
	  passwords.  Finish implementation of --set-admin-password option.

Mon Nov 05 09:31:29 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cp.conf: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=52 Disable

	  entered, twice.

Fri Nov 02 12:08:03 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/getsvnrev.py,src/version.py: Fix a fix issues when running
	  getsvnrev (including better handling of errors when running the
	  svn tools). Make version.py use getsvnrev, or the stored
	  svnrevision.py file, to get the svn revision, instead of using an
	  SVN keyword.

Fri Nov 02 11:48:35 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/static/css/main.css,src/templates/collections.html: table
	  border faked for IE7, ugh

	  Snapshotting progress for issue 72 work. Still need to change the
	  way formats are displayed in the UI, and verify that it actually
	  filters as intended.

Thu Nov 01 16:58:27 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt: further comments
	  on building Xapian

Thu Nov 01 11:27:59 UTC 2007  paul.x.rudin@gmail.com

	* src/indexserver/remote_filter.py: implemented a restart limit for
	  the remote_filter process - this is to partially address the
	  problem of filters that leak memory. Also in FilterRunner.run -
	  took the generation of the results inside the try block. Formerly
	  the actual iteration was outside the try so exceptions were not
	  necessailry caught if they were raised during the generation of
	  blocks rather than setting up the filter.

Thu Nov 01 10:54:47 UTC 2007  paul.x.rudin@gmail.com

	* src/indexserver/remote_filter.py: more logging.

Thu Nov 01 09:38:59 UTC 2007  paul.x.rudin@gmail.com

	* src/indexserver/remote_filter.py:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=56
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=71 Added
	  additional checks to see whether the remote process is still
	  running and to deal with exceptions raised by a filter running in
	  a remote process. If the remote process raises an uncaught
	  exception kill it and restart. This ensures that the next
	  document won't timeout because the remote process has become
	  unresponsive. It also deal partially with the problem of growing
	  memory use due (we think) to a problem with the adobe IFilter.
	  Added some logging calls.

Wed Oct 31 18:25:02 UTC 2007  paul.x.rudin@gmail.com

	* src/test/issue71.py: added more comments.

Wed Oct 31 18:18:02 UTC 2007  paul.x.rudin@gmail.com

	* src/test/issue71.py: More simple experiments - suggesting that
	  the problem might be specifically to do with the pdf IFilter.

Wed Oct 31 18:09:15 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt: note about M$

Wed Oct 31 17:34:53 UTC 2007  paul.x.rudin@gmail.com

	* src/test/issue71.py: added a function to repeatedly call a remote

Wed Oct 31 17:32:40 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/setup_svc.py: remove Windows dir

Wed Oct 31 16:47:15 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/setup_svc.py: make sure setup.exe has correct version
	  information

Wed Oct 31 16:24:45 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt,w32setup/flax.iss,
	  w32setup/makew32svc.bat,w32setup/setup_svc.py: Now setup_svc.py
	  does all the hard work, remove handcoded .iss and .bat files

Wed Oct 31 16:23:53 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxservice.py: close files opened for stdout and stderr, for

Wed Oct 31 10:26:20 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/flaxpaths.py: Added a call to paths.set_dirs to facilitate

Tue Oct 30 18:47:09 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/static/css/main.css,src/templates/about.html,
	  src/templates/admin_banner.html,src/templates/search.html,
	  src/templates/user_banner.html,src/templates.py: Link to the
	  "about" pages, and integrate them with the navigation stuff.

Tue Oct 30 16:43:41 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/templates/about.html,
	  src/templates/index.html,src/templates.py: Add an about page (to
	  both admin and user pages).  Not yet linked in.  Add lots of
	  documentation comments, and reformat a few bits of messy code and
	  whitespace.  Also, rename "real_id" to "nav_id", since it's only
	  used for navigation, and add a documentation comment describing
	  it.

Tue Oct 30 15:39:22 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/remote_filter.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=63 Fixed
	  indentation error in FilterRunner.

Tue Oct 30 14:25:25 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/startflax.py: Add --version option to display the version,
	  and --set-admin-password option which reads a new admin password
	  from stdin.  Still need to implement a method in cpserver.py to
	  actually store the new admin password.

Tue Oct 30 12:29:10 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates.py: Remove all XML comments from the generated HTML
	  pages.

Tue Oct 30 12:22:36 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/collection_detail.html,src/templates/flax.html:
	  Tidy up some of the comments.

Tue Oct 30 12:07:20 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/admin_banner.html,
	  src/templates/collection_detail.html,
	  src/templates/collections.html,src/templates/flax.html,
	  src/templates/index.html,src/templates/options.html,
	  src/templates/search.html,src/templates/user_banner.html: Remove
	  the $ID: keyword things.

Tue Oct 30 11:48:05 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/flax.html: Correct a typo and set the character set
	  to UTF-8.  (Used to be set in the <?xml declaration, but we're
	  HTML 4.01 transitional now)

Tue Oct 30 10:53:09 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/templates/search.html,src/templates.py: Re:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=59 The
	  previous fix had the unintended side effect of posts to advanced
	  search pages resulting in the simple search form being displayed.
	  Instead we redirect to the search form from the root url. Re:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=60 Don't try
	  to render results if there are no collections.

Tue Oct 30 10:23:43 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates/search.html:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=59 Added an
	  explicit action for the search form to deal with issue 59.

Tue Oct 30 09:58:09 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py: Put the redirect back, so that users can refresh
	  on the options page to get the up-to-date settings, even after
	  they've changed an option.

Tue Oct 30 09:38:32 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt: I've put
	  appropriate tarballs into xappy/libs/, and SVN head doesn't
	  actually have all the bits xappy needs (it's on a branch, which
	  will be merged in a week or two), so point that out in this file.

Tue Oct 30 08:20:23 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/static/css/main.css,src/templates/admin_banner.html,
	  src/templates/search.html,src/templates/user_banner.html: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=54 Added links
	  for search/advanced search for user pages.

Tue Oct 30 08:18:10 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/startflax.py: Inadvertently ommitted from last checkin

Tue Oct 30 07:53:05 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates/search.html: removed commented out label for query.

Tue Oct 30 07:15:42 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py,src/indexserver/remote_filter.py,
	  src/logclient.py: Made a process class to participate in
	  recieving log configuration notification changes. Used it for the
	  indexer process and remote filter processes. This means that
	  logging configuration changes now affect logging done by filters
	  running under remote filters.

Tue Oct 30 06:00:52 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py: Removed the sleep after updating option in the
	  options page. I'd already implemented a different fix for the
	  global options part of issue 55 - see the log entry for flax.py
	  revision 557.

Tue Oct 30 01:36:41 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/version.py: Add a version number file, to keep track better.

Tue Oct 30 01:18:21 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py: Add a sleep after changing the settings to allow
	  the changes to propagate before displaying the new settings, and
	  a redirect to stop reloads resending the POST.  Fixes issue #55
	  well enough for 1.0.

Mon Oct 29 16:40:07 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Remove flush() after every document -
	  we shouldn't need this, and it'll be terrible for performance.

Mon Oct 29 16:38:34 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/test/testfilespec.py: Brought into line with current code.

Mon Oct 29 16:30:33 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/w32com_ifilter.py: Use a threadlocal storage to
	  ensure that the pythoncom.CoInitialize() call is only performed
	  once for each thread, and use the newer
	  pythoncom.CoInitializeEx() form instead.

Mon Oct 29 16:29:38 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/remote_filter.py: Don't call the sub-filter twice
	  for every file! Also, pass through exception return values from
	  filters, so we can log them appropriately.

Mon Oct 29 15:35:26 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/remote_filter.py: Add missing :

Mon Oct 29 15:33:10 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/remote_filter.py,
	  src/indexserver/w32com_ifilter.py: If we get an error in a remote
	  filter, allow it to be returned across the pipe instead of the
	  iterator, and then raise it from inside the remote filter.  If we
	  can't get an appropriate ifilter in w32com_ifilter, return the
	  com exception object via the pipe.

Mon Oct 29 15:10:17 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Set the max mem use setting to 0.1 -
	  a low value, but should be high enough not to lose too much
	  performance, and should avoid risk of swapping.

Mon Oct 29 14:16:39 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/memutils.py: Remove this again - I've put it into xappy.

Mon Oct 29 13:30:36 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/flax.py:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=55 Refreshed
	  the logging configuration immediately after setting it as a
	  partial workaround for issue 55. (This does mean that web server
	  process will set the current log settings twice.)

Mon Oct 29 13:21:20 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/memutils.py: Fixes.

Mon Oct 29 13:18:31 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/memutils.py: Routines to get available memory on a system.

Mon Oct 29 11:59:24 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates/flax.html: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=57 Changed to
	  html 4.01 transitional from xhtml so that IE renders pages
	  properly.

Mon Oct 29 06:17:15 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates/collection_detail.html: Added help text for the
	  name of the collection.

Mon Oct 29 06:13:55 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates/collection_detail.html: Removed commmented out
	  script elements in the head.

Mon Oct 29 06:06:25 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/static/js/yui: Removed yui as we're not using it at the
	  moment. It can be reinstated if need be.

Mon Oct 29 06:05:43 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates/collection_detail.html: Took out the reference to
	  serving files directly from Flax since we don't do this any more.

	  utils/log2cl.py: Even more eol-style changes.

Sun Oct 28 12:13:09 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cp.conf,src/epydoc.conf,src/flaxlog.conf,
	  src/static/css/main.css,src/templates/,src/test/testfilespec.py:
	  More eol-style=native properties.

	  src/indexserver/simple_text_filter.py,
	  src/indexserver/test_filters.py,
	  src/indexserver/w32com_ifilter.py: Convert line endings to
	  native, and set the EOL style property to "native", which should
	  avoid further confusion with line endings.

Sun Oct 28 12:01:06 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/: Remove SVN keywords (ie, $id: entries) and set the EOL
	  style property to "native", which should avoid further confusion
	  with line endings.

	* src/dbspec.py,src/flaxservice.py,src/uistrings.py,src/util.py:
	  Convert all line endings to unix style.

Sun Oct 28 11:50:01 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* LICENSE: Tidy up, and use the standard GPL boilerplate text.

	* src/indexserver/w32com_ifilter.py: Tidy up comments and
	  whitespace.  Add license header to this file, including the BSD
	  license text from the "Python for windows" extensions that this
	  file was partly derived from.

Sat Oct 27 10:57:58 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/test_filters.py: utility for testing (not used in
	  main code).

	  src/templates/advanced_search.html,src/templates/search.html,
	  src/templates.py: Populate (advanced)search form with values that
	  yielded result when showing the results.

Sat Oct 27 07:38:11 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=43 Switched to
	  using SyncManager rather than LocalManager to deal with issue 43.
	  I think the route cause of the problem is probably a bug in the
	  processing LocalManager code (on Windows at least). The cleanup
	  code for the localmanger tries to delete a temp file whilst
	  another process still has a handle on it. If you terminate
	  subprocesses manually then the problem goes away, but the whole
	  point of having daemonic processes is that the infrastructure is
	  supposed to tidy them up for you.

Sat Oct 27 07:03:58 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/startflax.py: (Inadvertently ommitted from last checkin)

Sat Oct 27 06:57:12 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Refactored to split out the indexing
	  process from the controlling logic. Simplified the communication
	  with the indexer.

Sat Oct 27 06:55:01 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/filespec.py: Added a check for existence and a call to
	  realpath to avoid errors when walking to (dangling) symlinks.

Sat Oct 27 05:34:39 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/startflax.py: Called os.path.realpath on any paths we are
	  passed on the command line.

Sat Oct 27 00:42:33 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates.py: Tidy whitespace, and don't highlight query
	  terms for similarity queries (since the user didn't choose the
	  terms, and therefore probably isn't particularly interested in
	  whether the exact terms in the query are present.

Sat Oct 27 00:38:28 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/search.py: Tidy up whitespace, and add a checkatleast value
	  of 100, so that match estimates are always accurate if they're
	  under 100.

Fri Oct 26 20:03:58 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: In log message generation: replaced
	  dbpath with dbname, as that what's it's (now) called.

Fri Oct 26 17:39:13 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/search.py,src/templates.py: Formed an
	  appropriate query from the advanced search form inputs.
	  Refactored passing of arguments to search rendering, since
	  advanced is now implicit in the template. Added extra data to the
	  key to the template cache to account for the fact that different
	  urls can be generated from the same file name, so we need to
	  differentiate the cached templates on this basis.

Fri Oct 26 17:36:34 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/util.py: Tidy up documentation comments for AsyncFunc.

Fri Oct 26 16:23:27 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/collection_list.py,src/doc_collection.py: Revert r492, which
	  removed reference to flaxpaths from inside doc_collection, since
	  this now works even in the subprocess.

Fri Oct 26 16:19:00 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* w32setup,w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt,
	  w32setup/flax.iss,w32setup/gpl.txt,w32setup/makew32svc.bat,
	  w32setup/setup_svc.py: First pass of build files for Flax
	  standalone on Windows

Fri Oct 26 16:18:43 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Put flaxpaths into object which gets
	  pickled and passed across to subprocess on windows.

Fri Oct 26 15:59:04 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxservice.py: Added some extra comments about how to run in
	  a non-frozen environment

Fri Oct 26 15:54:28 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxservice.py: Remove an old FIXME - I did the checking it
	  was to remind me about.

Fri Oct 26 15:51:28 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/collection_list.py,src/cpserver.py,src/search.py: Removed
	  format handling code in search form processing since the form no
	  longer has elements for formats.

Fri Oct 26 15:49:56 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates.py: In render_search_result: corrected subnode
	  references when filling in "no search results" stuff.

Fri Oct 26 15:42:52 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates/advanced_search.html,src/templates.py: Removed
	  formats from advanced search form.

Fri Oct 26 15:34:31 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Remove old file - this was renamed to
	  flaxservice.py, but got left in the repo somehow.

Fri Oct 26 15:22:52 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=48 In
	  TemplateManager.make_template: added AttributeError to the catch
	  clause when setting the banner id to cope with pages that don't
	  have a banner.

Fri Oct 26 15:10:50 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates.py: Display the url to the document instead of a
	  title if no title is found - unless there is also no mapping, in
	  which case we display the filename.

Fri Oct 26 14:47:28 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/doc_collection.py: Fix documentation comment, and change \ in
	  file paths to / when making a URL, to work on windows.  Return ""
	  instead of "/" if there is no mapping - as described by the
	  documentation comment, and because it's easier to test for to
	  provide alternative handling.

Fri Oct 26 14:25:53 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxlog.conf: Change default log configuration to be NOTSET
	  for all but the default logger, and the default logger to be
	  WARNING.  At least this logging configuration is easy to describe
	  in documentation!

Fri Oct 26 14:20:26 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxlog.conf: Change default log configuration to use
	  FlaxRotatingFileHandler

Fri Oct 26 14:19:42 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxloghandlers.py,src/logclient.py: Add a custom log
	  handler, to log to the flax log output directory.  Needs to be
	  added into the logger namespace to be used, so do that in the
	  logclient.py module setup.

Fri Oct 26 13:23:57 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/startflax.py: Setup the logging options before reading the
	  main configuration, so that problems with it (like an old version
	  number) can be reported.

Fri Oct 26 12:02:24 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py: Correct a comment typo and remove an unnecessary
	  test.

Fri Oct 26 08:57:58 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxservice.py: make sure stdout and stderr end up in logs/
	  subfolder

Fri Oct 26 07:25:18 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/w32com_ifilter.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=35 Ensured
	  that the data returned by the filter is unicode. Note that this
	  change affect things at indexing time, so collections must be re-
	  indexed to notice the effect of this change.

Fri Oct 26 05:16:22 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/doc_collection.py: In search_conn. If we get a xapian
	  DatabaseOpeningError when trying to make a search connection then
	  remake the database. To deal with the possibility that the
	  database has been moved/deleted.

Thu Oct 25 17:44:29 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/flax.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=46 Added .htm
	  to formats

Thu Oct 25 16:05:00 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/static/css/main.css,src/templates/,
	  src/templates.py: Removed the (near-)duplicated search templates
	  and just used one (fixes:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=32) Moved the
	  rendering of the admin navigation to css, and hence removed the
	  dependency on cherrypy in templates.py Removed the onload from
	  the main template and refactored templates that need a call to
	  include one. (Fixes
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=30)

Thu Oct 25 12:33:56 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_w32.py: fix Registry path

Thu Oct 25 12:02:52 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxservice.py: Rename for easier typing of eventual
	  executable!

Thu Oct 25 12:02:02 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_w32.py: Remove executable path as no longer needed

Thu Oct 25 12:01:30 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Change the way we set sys.executable to work
	  better in a Py2exe Service

Thu Oct 25 11:59:04 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/startflax.py: Allow src_dir to be set (on Windows we must be
	  able to set it otherwise /static won't work)

Thu Oct 25 02:00:45 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/flax_w32.py,src/flaxpaths.py,src/startflax.py: Reinstated
	  src_dir so that we can have a seperate path for things that
	  naturally live in svn. Incorporated the startup logic from
	  flax_w32 into the main startup code in startflax.

Thu Oct 25 01:37:18 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/flax_w32.py: standardised line endings

Thu Oct 25 01:36:00 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/start.py,src/startflax.py: rename to startflax

Thu Oct 25 01:26:46 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/collection_list.py,src/cpserver.py,src/search.py: Made a
	  start on the advanced search form functionality. It doesn't yet
	  do the right thing...

Wed Oct 24 15:48:10 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Removed Registry stuff to a different
	  module; tidied debug prints to use LogInfoMsg; tied stdout and
	  stderr handling; added some more EventLog messages (temporarily)

Wed Oct 24 15:46:27 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_w32.py: New class encapsulating data read from Registry,
	  and a new main() loop for when running as a Windows command line
	  application

Wed Oct 24 15:41:36 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxpaths.py: Removed src_dir as no longer needed in Win32
	  startup

Wed Oct 24 07:31:34 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/collection_list.py,src/doc_collection.py,src/flax.py: Passed
	  the database directory to collections on creation, because the
	  pickled copy of a collection in the indexing process needs to
	  know the path to its database, which doesn't work correctly by
	  attempting to read the flaxpaths.paths object - the one in the
	  indexing process doesn't have the correct values. This is a
	  functional change in that the path to a collections database is
	  fixed at the creation time of the collection. We could arrange to
	  syncronise the global state between the processes if need be.

Wed Oct 24 07:26:30 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: In IndexServer.__init__ Use
	  processing.Lock rather than threading.Lock (see comments in the
	  file for reason).

Tue Oct 23 05:18:56 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/flaxpaths.py,src/start.py: Ensured that the path options are
	  used correctly when running from the command line.

Mon Oct 22 14:17:14 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/start.py: Put freezeSupport() back in - we need it for Py2exe
	  (and it's in the Service anyway, and shouldn't have any ill
	  effects)

Mon Oct 22 14:00:00 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Set src_dir from Registry so static\ paths
	  etc are correct

Mon Oct 22 13:59:18 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxpaths.py: Make it possible to set src_dir (we need this
	  when running frozen under Py2exe)

Mon Oct 22 11:28:09 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/indexserver/indexer.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=14 Added a
	  stop_indexing method to IndexServer and used to stop indexing
	  after a collection is updated. Added a lock to ensure that
	  changes to .stop_sv and and currently_indexing happen togther. In
	  indexer.do_indexing added a flush for the indexer connection in
	  the main loop. This was because a) Ram usage can get large, and
	  b) holding/stopping indexing can seem very unresponsive if there
	  is still a lot of work outstanding when the stop flag is set.

Mon Oct 22 10:22:09 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py,src/start.py: Must set logconfpath for
	  the index server at creation, because the indexserver runs in a
	  different process and won't see the same Flaxpaths as we
	  originally created

Mon Oct 22 08:48:46 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py: Took out the FIXME in Collections.new and
	  created http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=39 to
	  address this and similar issues.

Sun Oct 21 21:02:15 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/templates/collections.html,src/templates.py:
	  Implemented collection deletion. Possible outstanding related
	  issues: Maybe a confimation prompt? Also delete the underlying
	  xapian database?

Sun Oct 21 20:46:58 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates/collections.html: Brought the descriptive text into
	  line with the table.

Sun Oct 21 17:50:44 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=14 Set a
	  collection as due for indexing after it's been update. This
	  change doesn't stop a currently indexing collection as suggested
	  in comment 3. I'm not sure what's needed to acheive this atm.
	  There's no queue of actions for each collection, so we'd need to
	  hold it until it stops, then unhold it. But there are either
	  synchronisation or blocking issues.

Sun Oct 21 14:42:57 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/doc_collection.py,src/flax.py,
	  src/indexserver/indexer.py,src/scheduler.py,src/start.py,
	  src/templates/collection_detail.html,
	  src/templates/collections.html,src/templates.py,src/util.py:
	  Refactored the way that indexing is controlled. All the logic
	  about what gets indexed and when is in the main process. The
	  indexing process just responds to requests to index things. The
	  shared state for reporting on the indexing progress and for
	  prematurely stopping the indexer is all done via shared memory
	  now. Cached information about the last indexing of document
	  collections in the collection object itself, so that something
	  useful can be shown after a restart. Updated the UI to display
	  such information. Fixed a problem with log configuration
	  propogation to the indexing process.

Fri Oct 19 14:43:22 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/static/img/flax.125trans.png,
	  src/static/img/flax.250trans.png: Changed logo to include Site
	  Search

Fri Oct 19 14:34:11 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates.py: Changed for issue 34

Fri Oct 19 14:32:45 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/advanced_search.html,
	  src/templates/search_result_admin.html: Reverted, as it makes
	  less sense now

Fri Oct 19 13:11:25 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax.py: Fixed issue 33

Fri Oct 19 12:51:43 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/static/css/main.css: changed collection table head to pale
	  blue

Fri Oct 19 08:44:43 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/util.py: Added AsyncFunc

Fri Oct 19 05:21:01 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/util.py: Removed IO as it is not used any more.

Fri Oct 19 00:48:43 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Add the processing.freezeSupport() call back
	  - it'll be needed if we ever want to build with py2exe, we're
	  likely to forget it, and it doesn't seem to cause problems on
	  machines I have access to.  Also, tidy up some code comments.

Thu Oct 18 15:43:46 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/remote_filter.py: Correct trivial typos.

Thu Oct 18 15:16:10 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Add another Event Log message for after
	  everything has shut down successfully

Thu Oct 18 15:08:31 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py,src/start.py: Add join() method back (though
	  don't use a separate thread behind it).  Also add a timeout to
	  join() so that the SvcDoRun() method can reassure windows that
	  it's still doing something while shutting down.

Thu Oct 18 14:53:51 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Tidy up lots of code comments, particularly
	  giving more detail for FIXMEs. Add Python.exe to python paths
	  read from the registry if the path points to a directory - this
	  allows either a directory or a full path to be specified in the
	  registry (we should use a full path in the installer, probably).
	  call sys.exitfunc() at the end of SvcDoRun, so it only happens
	  after _flax_main.start() has exited, rather than calling it in
	  SvcStop(), where it was called immediately after the signal to
	  stop was called.

Wed Oct 17 21:01:26 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/flax_service.py,src/start.py: Various changes
	  to get things working more smoothly when running as a windows
	  service. - Took out some exception catching, this means that
	  unhandled exceptions will end up in the system event log where we
	  can see them. - set sys.argv[0] to '' when we're running as a
	  service to get round an exception that's raised in processing. I
	  don't fully understand what's going on here (the error is new
	  with 0.35 of processing - I'm not sure if it's really a bug in
	  that module, or we're doing something bad that's causing the
	  exception). - Made an explicit latish call to sys.exitfuncs. I'm
	  not sure why we need to do this, but since we're not running
	  under the standard python.exe I guess that for some reason it
	  doesn't get called automatically. This is necessary to ensure
	  that anything registered with the atexit module to run on
	  termination actually get called on termination. - remove call to
	  processing.freezeSupport. It doesn't seem to do anything useful
	  at the moment - we can put it back if there's a reason to. -
	  Simplified by getting rid of the separate thread to run cherrypy
	  and used the facilities provided by cp to run start without
	  blocking, then used an explicit call to stop cp.

Wed Oct 17 14:37:13 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: some extra debug

Wed Oct 17 11:20:08 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

Mon Oct 15 15:14:39 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/flaxpaths.py,src/start.py: Fix finding of the
	  template directory (was using hardcoded path).

Mon Oct 15 15:08:15 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/static/css/main.css,src/templates/collection_detail.html:
	  More tidying up of collection details

Mon Oct 15 14:55:53 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/collection_detail.html: simple readability tweak to
	  collection details

Mon Oct 15 14:17:26 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: truncate stderr and stdout log files

Mon Oct 15 14:12:57 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/collection_list.py,src/dbspec.py,src/doc_collection.py,
	  src/flax.py,src/indexserver/indexer.py: Tidy up the handling of
	  paths for databases - the database path configured by flaxpaths
	  is now respected.

Mon Oct 15 14:01:58 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Fixed to use new paths interface in start.py

Mon Oct 15 13:39:43 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cp.conf,src/flax.py,src/indexserver/indexer.py,
	  src/logclient.py,src/start.py: Rework the path handling, to use
	  flaxpaths.  Some items still need reworking.

Mon Oct 15 12:39:47 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxpaths.py: Further updates

Mon Oct 15 12:37:38 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/search.py,src/templates.py: If there are no collections, and
	  a search is performed, display a message saying that there are no
	  collections, rather than displaying a traceback.

Mon Oct 15 12:07:20 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flaxpaths.py: Centralised handling for file paths.

Mon Oct 15 11:59:39 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Some tidyups.

Mon Oct 15 11:40:23 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/templates/options.html,src/templates.py:
	  Remove option to set the flax directory at run-time - semantics
	  are too confusing to specify (eg, should existing databases be
	  moved, etc).  Instead, we'll allow it to be specified in the
	  installer, or as a command line parameter when starting the
	  server.

Mon Oct 15 11:34:29 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/indexserver/indexer.py,src/start.py: Revert
	  commits 441 and 443 - I have a better fix.

Mon Oct 15 11:09:52 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/indexserver/indexer.py: Use a passed in path

Mon Oct 15 11:05:33 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Tiny typo in comment.

Mon Oct 15 11:05:01 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/start.py: Attempt to pass the correct paths to other modules
	  at startup

Mon Oct 15 11:04:27 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Use the default installation folder if we
	  can't read the Registry; use regutils to try and find the
	  interpreter; attempt to pass the main path to various other
	  modules

Mon Oct 15 10:45:35 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/static/css/main.css,src/templates/admin_banner.html,
	  src/templates.py: Generate admin tabs from a list

Mon Oct 15 10:22:51 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/doc_collection.py,src/flax.py,
	  src/indexserver/indexer.py,src/search.py,
	  src/templates/collections.html,src/templates.py:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=7 Made
	  infrastructure for discovering status of indexer and used the
	  results in the collection list page. I'm not exactly sure what
	  statistics are useful or interesting, but at least now it should
	  be straigtforward to add things to the dictionaries used for this
	  information. We use a search connection for collections in a few
	  places so I've cached one in the DocCollection object and
	  (ensured that we don't try to pickle it).

Mon Oct 15 10:08:44 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/templates/admin_banner.html: removed admin
	  home

Mon Oct 15 01:08:55 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Tidy up the imports, change some of
	  the log.info messages to log.debug (we only need one message per
	  file at info level, I think) and pass the logconf path to the
	  indexing loop rather than using the hardcoded default.  (The path
	  passed is the hardcoded default, but that can be fixed easily.)

Mon Oct 15 01:01:50 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/start.py: Pass the path to the CherryPy
	  configuration file to cpserver.start_web_server(), rather than
	  hard-coding it in cpserver.  Is currently hardcoded in start.py,
	  but I'll fix that shortly...

Mon Oct 15 00:57:34 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py: Display a different message if no collection
	  name is specified when making a new collection to if the
	  collection name is already in use. Both of these cases need to be
	  tidied up (currently, they just display a traceback with the
	  message at the end), but at least the distint causes are now
	  clear.

Mon Oct 15 00:54:49 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* cpserver.py,src/cpserver.py,src/templates.py,templates.py:
	  Introduce a Renderer class, and move all the *_render functions
	  from the end of the module into this class.  Gets rid of the need
	  to have a single global TemplateManager object, which may be
	  handy later, and adds a more natural location for specifying the
	  path to the template directory (ie, in the constructor of the
	  Renderer class).  Also, use the new uistrings in a few places.
	  Create a templates.Renderer when starting the web server, and use
	  this instead of the old global functions to render the templates.

Mon Oct 15 00:46:26 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py: Remove incorrect _ from
	  self._collections._formats

Mon Oct 15 00:39:02 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/uistrings.py: Add some uistring messages for spelling
	  correction.

Mon Oct 15 00:26:38 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/search.py: Check if the spell corrected query actually
	  matches anything - if it doesn't, don't suggest it, or use it
	  automatically.

Sun Oct 14 23:54:38 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/logclient.py: Tidy whitespace, and rename "filename" member
	  to "filepath", since it needs to be a full path (if we want to be
	  independent of current working directory, as we do when running
	  as a windows service).

Sun Oct 14 23:17:42 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/collection_list.py: Add missing quotes around bareword
	  "formats".

Sun Oct 14 17:19:47 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates.py: Remove "html_dir" parameter to TemplateManager
	  constructor, and the write_html_file() method - it wasn't being
	  used anywhere.  Cleanup whitespace and formatting in a few
	  places.

Sun Oct 14 15:46:26 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates.py: removed a debugging print.

Sun Oct 14 15:45:15 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/doc_collection.py: removed the call of normpath on paths -
	  inadvertently included in last check in.

Sun Oct 14 14:14:16 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=28 string-
	  escape encoded the paths for the embedded javascript.

Sun Oct 14 13:51:53 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates.py: removed debugging print.

Sun Oct 14 13:50:39 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/collection_list.py,src/cpserver.py,src/doc_collection.py,
	  src/flax.py,src/search.py,src/templates/search_result.html,
	  src/templates/search_result_admin.html,src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=20 Used the
	  xapian spell correction facility to find spell corrections.
	  Automatically use this when oringinal query returns no results.
	  Show these in the UI. Refactored search results to package up
	  related information in an object.

Sun Oct 14 13:46:59 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: split long line

Sat Oct 13 10:40:22 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Remove extraneous whitespace.

Sat Oct 13 10:38:37 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Add a name for the index server
	  process, for better debugging output.

Sat Oct 13 10:21:25 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Add a FIXME note.

Sat Oct 13 10:20:27 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/start.py: Clean up startup when non-blocking.

Sat Oct 13 00:53:21 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Oops.  Avoid infinite loop.

Sat Oct 13 00:52:05 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Attempt to set sys.executable to a valid
	  python interpreter (and give an error if we can't).  This is
	  absolutely needed for processing to work on windows.

Fri Oct 12 23:32:44 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/start.py: Fix blatant bugs in stopping code.

Fri Oct 12 23:25:24 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/start.py: Another stupid typo.

Fri Oct 12 23:22:57 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/start.py: Add import of threading module.

Fri Oct 12 23:21:53 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Fix typo.

Fri Oct 12 23:19:27 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Various fixes, and make the service output
	  error information if an uncaught exception is thrown.

Fri Oct 12 21:31:00 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Add import of processing when running from
	  command line.

Fri Oct 12 21:25:30 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/persist.py: Bah - typo.

Fri Oct 12 21:24:29 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/persist.py: Cope with more broken flax.flx files.

Fri Oct 12 21:19:49 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/util.py: Tidy up setting of paths.

Fri Oct 12 21:18:21 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Add work-around to prevent signal causing an
	  error when run as a service.

Fri Oct 12 21:06:30 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: Make flax_service use start.py to handle all
	  the stuff which needs to be started or stopped.

Fri Oct 12 16:07:47 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/start.py: Add infrastructure so that all the flax services
	  can be started with a single call, and signalled to stop, and
	  then stopped. (We may need to do more work to get the stop to
	  work cleanly, but the interface is now one which should be usable
	  from the win32 service startup module)

Fri Oct 12 15:18:00 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/flax.html: Split startup code out of cpserver.  You
	  now need to run "python start.py" instead of "python
	  cpserver.py".

Fri Oct 12 15:04:08 UTC 2007  Charlie Hull <charlie@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax_service.py: prototype service wrapper

Fri Oct 12 14:09:15 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cp.conf,src/static/img/favicon.ico: added custom favicon.ico

Fri Oct 12 13:41:04 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/static/css/main.css,src/templates/search_result.html,
	  src/templates/search_result_admin.html: Moved and restyled
	  similar link

Fri Oct 12 13:19:52 UTC 2007  Tom Mortimer <tom@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/static/css/main.css,src/templates/search_admin.html,
	  src/templates/search_result_admin.html,src/templates.py: neater
	  admin search layout

Fri Oct 12 11:38:22 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/start.py: Split startup code out of cpserver,
	  and put it in new file "start.py"

Fri Oct 12 11:37:21 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* README: Update instructions on starting flax.

Fri Oct 12 11:35:34 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/__init__.py,src/indexserver/indexer.py: Make
	  indexserver into a module, and move setuppaths before import of
	  processing.

Fri Oct 12 11:34:53 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/filespec.py: Add some debugging logging.

Fri Oct 12 11:23:06 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/doc_collection.py: Removed the ability to
	  search document source files via Flax as it might be a bit of a
	  security hole. Also removed the code to make urls pointing at
	  this when no mapping is supplied for a path.

Fri Oct 12 10:52:01 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/dbspec.py,src/flax.py,src/indexserver/indexer.py: Rework
	  dbspec.py to separate out the configuration of internal fields
	  from ones which filters can return; makes a single source file
	  need to be modified to add configuration for a new internal
	  filter.  Increase the version number in flax.flx, since databases
	  will need to be re-created for the new configuration.

Fri Oct 12 10:49:27 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates.py: Encode title as utf-8.

Fri Oct 12 10:18:06 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/htmltotext_filter.py: Remove debug print.

Fri Oct 12 09:54:17 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/static/js/mapping.js,src/templates/collection_detail.html,
	  src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=11 Moved to
	  javascript for making the path/mapping inputs and added a button
	  to create more pairs.

Fri Oct 12 06:11:44 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/doc_collection.py,src/templates/collection_detail.html,
	  src/templates.py:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=11 Made a
	  start on mapping for paths, the mapping values are not yet used
	  and we need to inlude some javascript to push extra input boxes
	  into the page. FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=21 Mappings
	  are now used to generate the urls for files, and title are used
	  if available, to the work for issue 21 is done. (Probably some
	  cosmetic work on the "search for similar" link is desirable.)
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=11 Added code
	  to generate urls from doc ids based on the mappings. Also fixed a
	  problem with adding lots of blank mapping enties on round-
	  tripping. This "works" now, but still could do with some
	  javascript to add extra path/mapping input boxes without round-
	  tripping.

Fri Oct 12 01:06:37 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/dbspec.py,src/flax.py: Tidy up code and comments. Hardcode
	  the list of log levels, rather than getting them from the logger
	  module.  To get them from the logger module, we needed to
	  hardcode a set of values, anyway, and we'll break elsewhere if
	  the names change (not least, the configuration format will
	  change).  So I prefer to be explicit about the hard-coding.

Fri Oct 12 00:41:42 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/options.html: Update descriptions of logging
	  levels.

Fri Oct 12 00:40:22 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates.py: Use uistrings instead of "capitalize()" to get
	  the displayable form of the logging level.

Fri Oct 12 00:38:21 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: Tidy up some code and comments.

Fri Oct 12 00:09:25 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/collection_list.py: Tidy up documentation comments.

Fri Oct 12 00:03:41 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/uistrings.py: Add new file, which will hold any strings used
	  in the user interface in a single location.  Will make
	  translations of the UI easier in future.

Thu Oct 11 17:11:36 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/collection_list.py,src/cpserver.py,src/doc_collection.py,
	  src/flax.py,src/search.py,src/templates/collection_detail.html,
	  src/templates.py:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=11 Made a
	  start on mapping for paths, the mapping values are not yet used
	  and we need to inlude some javascript to push extra input boxes
	  into the page.
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=21 Refactored
	  the "search for similar" stuff so that (inter alia) the
	  pagination works for the results.

Thu Oct 11 17:08:24 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/util.py: added listify

Thu Oct 11 13:16:47 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax.py: Remove the variants of the english stemmer - they're
	  really no use to users.

Thu Oct 11 13:06:31 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/collection_list.py,src/flax.py,src/flax_collections.py:
	  Rename flax_collections.py to collection_list.py to go with the
	  internal class name.

Thu Oct 11 12:34:57 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/flax.py,src/flax_collections.py: Rename FlaxCollections to
	  CollectionList - the random "Flax" prefix was bugging me.

Thu Oct 11 09:08:03 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates.py: Remove diagnostic prints.

Thu Oct 11 08:16:34 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/flax.py,src/persist.py,src/search.py,
	  src/templates/search_result.html,src/templates.py: Implented a
	  simple version system for the pickled data. This means old
	  flax.flx file will (this time) cause an error, but thereafter a
	  warning about incompatible versions will be emmitted and data
	  reset to he defaults. Moved the log configuration further down
	  the startup code so that the root logger is configured before we
	  issue any warnings. Changes for "similar document search" as per
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=21 Added a
	  link for similar searches, not quite done yet as we need to get
	  back a string from the query (i.e. implement search.unparse()
	  properly)

Thu Oct 11 05:48:09 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: corrected missing comma in
	  _process_file

Thu Oct 11 04:58:50 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py: removed a diagnostic print.

Thu Oct 11 04:57:10 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/dbspec.py: imported types as it's used.

Wed Oct 10 23:04:12 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/flax.html: Change character encoding to utf-8: this
	  is the character set that output from xappy will be in, so we
	  might as well use it for display.

Wed Oct 10 16:28:11 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/doc_collection.py: Move future import before __docformat__.

Wed Oct 10 16:09:15 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/filespec.py,src/dbspec.py,src/doc_collection.py:
	  Add standard license and copyright header, and tidy up some code
	  comments and whitespace.  Remove "$ID:" markers.  Tidy up code to
	  follow PEP8 better (remove whitespace around = when specifying
	  default arguments to functions, and change multiline
	  documentation comments to start with """Single line of text...
	  and to end with a blank line before the closing """).
	  Change DBSpec.update() to accept any sequence or iterator for its
	  stopwords argument.

Wed Oct 10 16:07:42 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* utils/install_dependencies.py,utils/log2cl.py: Tidy up a couple
	  of comments.

Wed Oct 10 10:36:51 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates/collection_detail.html,src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=13 Made the UI
	  for the oldest property a dropdown.

Wed Oct 10 08:41:12 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/flax.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=12 Added rtf
	  to list of formats.

Wed Oct 10 08:38:08 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/filespec.py,src/templates/collection_detail.html,
	  src/templates/search.html,src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=13 Removed all
	  the date related stuff from filespecs except for the "oldest"
	  property. FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=9 Added a
	  definition list to search forms giving collection names and
	  descriptions.

Wed Oct 10 08:06:56 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/flaxlog.conf: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=26 Added
	  searching to the the keys attribute of the loggers section.

Tue Oct 09 17:35:16 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* libs/htmltotext/ChangeLog,libs/htmltotext/src/pyhtmltotext.cc:
	  src/pyhtmltotext.cc: Don't use a zero size array - MSVC doesn't
	  like it.

Tue Oct 09 14:08:00 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py,src/templates/collection_detail.html,
	  src/templates/collections.html,src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=10 Removed the
	  form on the collection listing page, added a new link for
	  creating a collection. Changed the detail form to cope with
	  updating or creation.

Tue Oct 09 10:10:49 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/dbspec.py,src/indexserver/indexer.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=18 Added a
	  "basename" field to hold the base filename, and arranged for the
	  indexer to add content to this. Also added a managed dictionary
	  to communicate the state of indexing between the indexer and web
	  server as per
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=7 ( not yet
	  complete).

Tue Oct 09 09:51:52 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/flax.py,src/templates/options.html,src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=23 Got rid of
	  the separate database directory and hard coded the database
	  directory to be a "dbs" subdir of whatever the flax directory is.

	* src/flax.py,src/templates/options.html,src/templates.py: FIXES:

	  the sub-loggers for individual filters from the UI, changed radio
	  buttons to checkboxes.

Tue Oct 09 09:40:20 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py: whitespace tidying.

Tue Oct 09 09:23:41 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py: removed the code to process filter settings
	  since the form no longer contains such elements.

Tue Oct 09 04:54:06 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=1 Checked for
	  existence of collection database. If it's not there log an error
	  and return. Ensure that we only try to close the db connection if
	  it's already been opened.

Tue Oct 09 04:39:43 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/w32com_ifilter.py: Removed duplicate import.

Mon Oct 08 19:13:42 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/templates/options.html,src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=3 Removed the
	  UI options to modify filter settings. Note that persistent data
	  with other filters set now have no user accessible way of
	  changing the filters, so flax.flx probably needs to be deleted.

	  the indexserver at the moment). Arranged for the web server to
	  start the indexserver process.

Sun Oct 07 11:16:49 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

Thu Oct 04 09:48:54 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

Wed Oct 03 16:47:46 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/dbspec.py,src/doc_collection.py,src/flax_collections.py: Use

	  party modules if they're only locally installed.
	* src/setuppaths.py: New module which simply calls
	  util.setup_sys_path() when it's imported.  This is convenient
	  because it will only call it the first time it's imported, so we
	  don't end up repeatedly modifying sys.path.
	* src/util.py: Add "lib" to sys.path as well as "libs/xappy", since
	  this is where the new utils/install_dependencies.py script puts
	  them.
	* ChangeLog: Update.

Wed Oct 03 16:00:42 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* utils/install_dependencies.py: Add script which downloads the

	  src/schedulespec.py,src/util.py: Refactoring to simplify thread
	  usage. Added some logging calls. Added a new logger name. Delete
	  flax.flx to see the new logger in the web app (should find

Tue Oct 02 12:17:54 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/schedulespec.py: (This file inadvertently ommited form last
	  commit.) Implemented a simple scheduling scheme and web page

	  documents. Documents include a "collection" field, and this
	  togther with the document id is used to verify that the file is
	  one that was actually indexed at some point. This provides a form
	  of security (so that we're not serving arbitrary files, but we
	  need to think harder about whether this provides a loophole
	  allowing any files from the server to be downloaded). (this file
	  inadvertently ommitted from last checkin.)

Wed Sep 26 12:05:13 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>
