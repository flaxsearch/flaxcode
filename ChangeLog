	* src/cpserver.py,src/filespec.py,src/dbspec.py,src/doc_collection.py:
	  Add standard license and copyright header, and tidy up some code
	  comments and whitespace.  Remove "$ID:" markers.  Tidy up code to
	  follow PEP8 better (remove whitespace around = when specifying
	  default arguments to functions, and change multiline
	  documentation comments to start with """Single line of text...
	  and to end with a blank line before the closing """).
	  Change DBSpec.update() to accept any sequence or iterator for its
	  stopwords argument.

	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=18 Added a
	  "basename" field to hold the base filename, and arranged for the
	  indexer to add content to this. Also added a managed dictionary

	* src/cpserver.py: whitespace tidying.

Tue Oct 09 09:23:41 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py: removed the code to process filter settings
	  since the form no longer contains such elements.

Tue Oct 09 04:54:06 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=1 Checked for

	* src/templates/options.html,src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=3 Removed the
	  UI options to modify filter settings. Note that persistent data
	  with other filters set now have no user accessible way of
	  changing the filters, so flax.flx probably needs to be deleted.

	  start the indexserver process.

Sun Oct 07 11:16:49 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/dbspec.py,src/doc_collection.py,src/flax_collections.py: Use

	  party modules if they're only locally installed.
	* src/setuppaths.py: New module which simply calls
	  util.setup_sys_path() when it's imported.  This is convenient
	  because it will only call it the first time it's imported, so we
	  don't end up repeatedly modifying sys.path.
	* src/util.py: Add "lib" to sys.path as well as "libs/xappy", since
	  this is where the new utils/install_dependencies.py script puts
	  them.
	* ChangeLog: Update.

Wed Oct 03 16:00:42 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* utils/install_dependencies.py: Add script which downloads the

Tue Oct 02 12:17:54 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/schedulespec.py: (This file inadvertently ommited form last
	  commit.) Implemented a simple scheduling scheme and web page

Wed Sep 26 12:06:28 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	  documents. Documents include a "collection" field, and this
	  togther with the document id is used to verify that the file is

	  of security (so that we're not serving arbitrary files, but we
	  need to think harder about whether this provides a loophole
	  allowing any files from the server to be downloaded). (this file
	  inadvertently ommitted from last checkin.)
