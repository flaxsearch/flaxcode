This is a minimal example of a flax.core indexing application, using lxml to
index XML.

To run the indexer, you will need Python 2.5 or higher plus:

    - lxml ( http://codespeak.net/lxml/ )
    - xapian ( http://xapian.org/ )
    - flax.core ( http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/source/checkout )

Run the indexer with the following parameters:

    $ python xml_indexer.py <db name> <xml file> <actions> <doc tag>

where:

    <db name> is the name of the database to create in DBDIR (see below)
    <xml file> is the path to the source XML data
    <actions> is the path to the indexer actions file
    <root tag> is the tag name of the XML element to be treated as a document

e.g. using the files provided in examples/ -

    $ python xml_indexer.py books.db examples/books.xml examples/books.actions book
