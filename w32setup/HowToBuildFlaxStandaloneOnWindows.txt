3. Install Python 2.5 (to the default folder, C:\Python25)
4. Add this folder to your Path (Control Panel, System, Advanced, Environment Variables)
5. Install pywin32 for Python 2.5

10. Copy the following files into the same folder as this text file:
    msvcr80.dll

    msvcr71.dll
10. Start a command line window (Start|Run|cmd.exe), and run
    cd \work\Flax
    python utils/install_dependencies.py
    cd win32setup
    python setup_svc.py install
11. The packaged, standalone Flax should be in the packages/ subfolder
