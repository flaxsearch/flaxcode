* Why is Flax Basic different to Google Desktop?

Flax Basic can be run across a network, so you can use it to search files that are shared between computers. Flax Basic also uses a web page interface, so you can easily access it from other computers. Google Desktop is designed to search files on a single computer only, whereas Flax Basic can be used from many computers.

* How much does Flax Basic cost?

Flax Basic is entirely free to download and use on as many computers as you want.

* What is Flax Basic based on?

Flax Basic is based on the Flax search solution platform developed by Lemur Consulting Ltd., an entirely open-source enterprise search system. Flax uses the Xapian search engine library, the CherryPy web application server and the Python programming language to provide a robust, scalable and high-performance search system. 

* What is the minimum specification for Flax Basic?

You will need a PC running Windows 2000, 2000 Server, 2003 Server, XP or Vista with at least 1GB of RAM (more is recommended) and enough hard disk space to build the databases (these are generally about the same size as the source files you want to be able to search). 

* What browsers does Flax Basic support?

Flax Basic supports Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6 and above and Mozilla Firefox version 1.5 and above. 

* How do I upgrade to a new version of Flax Basic without losing my data?

Uninstall Flax Basic and follow the instructions about upgrading, then install a new version of Flax Basic. The old data will be preserved.

* How do I back up the Flax Basic databases?

Flax Basic databases are held in a special 'data' folder (you will have chosen this when you installed Flax Basic). You can back this up by simply copying the appropriate folders. You should only do this when indexing has completed, otherwise you may make a copy of a database that does not contain all the files you might expect.

* Can I modify or extend Flax Basic?

Flax Basic is open-source licensed under the GPL; this means that you can also download the source code to Flax Basic (see www.flax.co.uk for details) and modify it to your requirements. However if you distribute this modified code you must also distribute the source code. If your modifications will be of benefit to other users, you can submit them to the Flax project and they may be incorporated into the next release of the software.

* I would like a feature that is not available in Flax Basic

Contact us at www.flax.co.uk and we can discuss how we might help you.

* How do I change the port that Flax Basic uses?

Flax Basic is by default available at port 8090; you can change this as follows: First, make sure Flax Basic is not running. If you installed Flax Basic as a Service, you can stop it by running the file "C:\Program Files\Flax Basic\stopflaxservice.bat", if it is running in a command window then close that window. Then edit the file C:\Program Files\Flax Basic\conf\cp.conf using Windows Notepad - change the "server.socket_port = 8090" line to a different port, and save the file. Restart the Flax Basic service if necessary by running the file "C:\Program Files\Flax Basic\startflaxservice.bat" and Flax should now be available on the new port.
 
* How many files can I search?

Given sufficient memory and hard disk space, Flax Basic can build indexes of millions (and even hundreds of millions) of files. 

* What file formats can Flax Basic read?

Flax Basic currently reads Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint, plain text, Rich Text Format (RTF), HTML and Adobe Acrobat (PDF) documents. Flax Basic uses the Microsoft IFilter system which is installed with all modern versions of Windows. Note that on some systems the RTF IFilter may not be present (see below) and on most systems the PDF IFilter will not be present unless Acrobat Reader is installed (see below).

* Why can't I index RTF documents on Windows 2000?

Windows 2000 does not include the IFilter for RTF documents, which is included with later versions of Windows. You may thus see some errors while indexing such as 'Unable to access object.' You can install the RTF IFilter from http://download.microsoft.com/download/SharePointPortalServer/Utility/1/NT5/EN-US/RTF.exe . Run the program to unzip the files and copy the rtffilt.dll file to C:\windows\system32 (or C:\winnt\system32), then register it by running Start, Run, 'regsvr32 rtffilt.dll'. Flax Basic should now index RTF files correctly.

* Why can't I index HTML documents on Windows 2000 Server?

Windows 2000 Server does not seem to register the HTML IFilter correctly. Stop indexing, register the IFilter by running Start, Run, 'regsvr32 nlhtml.dll', and restart indexing - the indexing should now work correctly.

* Why can't I index PDF documents?

You may not have the correct IFilter for Adobe Acrobat (PDF) documents installed. This IFilter is included with Acrobat Reader and is also available seperately from Adobe; you can download it from http://download.adobe.com/pub/adobe/acrobat/win/all/ifilter60.exe. After installing this program Flax Basic will be able to install PDF documents.

* How fast can I build my indexes?

This will depend on what types of files you want to index. In general, using the IFilter system, indexing PDF files is slowest, and indexing plain text and HTML is fastest. The speed of indexing will also depend on the speed of your system and how much memory is available.

* What version of Windows does Flax Basic need?

We have successfully tested Flax Basic on Windows 2000, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2003 Server, Windows XP and Windows Vista. 

* How do I customise the search page(s)?

If you want to change the appearance of any pages you will need to edit the templates in C:\Program Files\Flax Basic\templates and the stylesheet in C:\Program Files\Flax Basic\static\css (assuming you installed Flax Basic to the default folder). Make a backup of the pages first so you can roll back if you make a mistake! The easiest way to change the appearance of Flax Basic is to edit the user_banner.html page, as this is shown at the top of all pages that users see. 

* I've seen some errors while indexing, what does this mean?

This means that Flax Basic could not extract the text from some of the files it found (you should also notice that the number of Documents reported by the Collection Status page is less than the number of Files). To see more detail about the error check the indexer log file, which is found at C:\Program Files\Flax Basic\logs\flaxindexer.log (assuming you installed Flax Basic to the default folder). Look for a line such as:

<date> <time>,700: ERROR: Filtering file: <a path to a file> with filter: 

You should then try and open the file specified by <a path to a file> in an appropriate program (i.e., if it is a PDF file try opening it in Acrobat). The file may be malformed or have the wrong extension (i.e. an Excel file saved as .doc) or there may be other errors that prevent the IFilter system from reading it.

* I've seen some errors while indexing PDF files, what does this mean? I have the PDF IFilter installed correctly.

The Adobe IFilter sometimes reports errors while reading certain PDF files. Flax Basic attempts to work around this by reading as much of the rest of the file as possible.

* I've seen some other errors, how can I report them and/or find a solution?

If you have seen other errors while using Flax, please visit www.flax.co.uk to report them. We will endeavour to provide fixes and workarounds and will use the information to contribute to Flax's ongoing improvement.

* I've forgotten the password I set during installation, how do I reset it?

First, make sure Flax Basic is not running. If you installed Flax Basic as a Service, you can stop it by running the file "C:\Program Files\Flax Basic\stopflaxservice.bat", if it is running in a command window then close that window. Then open a command window (Start, Run, 'cmd') and type:

cd "C:\Program files\Flax Basic"
startflax --set-admin-password

Enter a new password and close the window, then restart the Flax Basic service if necessary by running the file "C:\Program Files\Flax Basic\startflaxservice.bat"
