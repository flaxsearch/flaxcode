Flax
----

Flax is a web based search system. See <http://www.flax.co.uk> for more
information.

If you are just interested in running Flax on Windows then the easiest
route is to use a prebuilt installer (available from the web site).

The current version can also be run from the command line on any
platform where the dependencies can be installed. This is known to work
on at least Windows (XP, Server 2003) , Linux (Ubuntu 7.10 - but any
recent distribution should do) and Mac OS X.

To build a Windows installer see
w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt

To run from the command line first ensure that you have the required
dependencies available. We assume in the following that this file is
contained in a directory 'flaxcode/' and this is the
current directory.

Dependencies
------------

Flax depends on Python 2.5, available from http://www.python.org/

Flax also depends on several Python modules which are not part of the
standard distribution.  The easiest way to install these dependencies is
simply to run:

   python utils/install_dependencies.py

This will install the dependencies locally (to a directory "localinst",
which flax looks for when it starts up), so you won't need root or
administrator privileges.

Flax also depends on Xapian, its python bindings and the Xappy interface to Xapian; 
as well as the processing module, which you currently need to install manually. See
http://www.xapian.org (you will need to use a recent snapshot) and
http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/processing (currently we use the
0.34 release).

If you want to install the dependencies manually, then examine 
utils/install_dependecies to see what it does.

The install_dependencies.py script places versions of these packages in
subdirectory 'localinst' that is added to the python path in the
code. It is not necessary that these packages are in this location,
but they must be importable.


Running from the Command Line
-----------------------------

Change directories to the src/ subdirectory, and then:

  python startflax.py

On Windows, if you have already run the Windows installer, some paths
will be set in the registry, so if you want to run independently
of the installed version then pass some command line options to
override the registry settings, for example::

  python startflax.py --src-dir=. main-dir=data. conf-dir=.

More information about the command line options can be obtained by running::

  python startflax.py --help

If you see a message about the file "auth.conf" then run the same
command but with the additional option "--set-admin-password", this
will prompt you to specify the password for access to the
administrator web UI and then exit. This need only be done once but
note that the if you use a different location for "--conf-dir" then the
file auth.conf must be moved, or else a new one created by resetting
the password.

By default the web server will run on port 8090, but you can change
that by editing cp.conf. The server can be terminated by raising
KeyboardInterrupt (normally hitting Control-C).

Note that Flax will start some other processes. These should all die
when the main process finishes, in the event of abnormal termination
then (depending on operating system) it might be that the other
processes are not terminated and will need to be killed manually.

There is more information on the internals of Flax available in
flaxcode/src/hacking.rst.
